# Kristiyan Tsvetanov

I build systems that make money.

Not toy projects.  
Not tutorial clones.  
Real infrastructure, real clients, real revenue.

Founder of **TsvWeb** – a web engineering and SaaS studio focused on high-performance websites, automation, and AI-powered products.

## What I actually do

- Design and ship production web platforms
- Build SaaS products from scratch
- Self-host and manage my own infrastructure
- Automate businesses with AI + custom tooling
- Close clients and run retainers, not one-off gigs

If it can be automated, scaled, or monetised, I build it.

## Current ecosystem

### TsvWeb
Web development + hosting + maintenance retainers  
Clients in e-commerce, clinics, beauty, and sports

### TsvTeach

### Vonlix

### Internal tools

## Philosophy

- Ship fast
- Control your infrastructure
- Recurring revenue > one-off projects
- Systems > hustle
- Assets > hours

Most people code.  
I build leverage.
